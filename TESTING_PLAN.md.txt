4. Automated Test List
Which tests were candidates for Automation? 


* Recapture gameplay of a chosen level. 
* The player can skip cutscenes with dialogue.
* The player can start up tutorial interactions.




For each candidate, which kind of automated testing is recommended:  
repetitive, rule-based, or high-volume?




Repetitive:
-Gameplay is constantly recorded, and after it is downloadable automatically.
