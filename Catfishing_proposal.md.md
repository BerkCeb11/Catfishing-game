**Backstory:**  
Cat lives in a world where most land is submerged underwater. Every ocean and sea inhabits a dangerous marine creature based off the continent of the ocean. Each marine boss has its own kingdom and lair as well as their own henchmen/servants. Inside the lairs, holds a delectable type of fish treat Cat searches for. Even though the bosses are defeatable, not everything is edible because of Cat’s tolerance. The environments host a lot of obstacles as well leading to the kingdoms. There’ll be different types of wind currents in the water, as well as underwater volcanos.

The only thing Cat remembers about spawning is resurfacing the ocean and hanging on a clump of seaweed adrift. Cat finds a submarine diving helmet and uses it to explore underwater as there’s barely any land to explore. Cat is a cheeky character who’s playful and adventurous with a big appetite. Cat stumbles upon its first sea kingdom run by a sea slug and defeats it after stepping on it by accident. This is Cat’s first time where it finds a yummy fish and decides to go on search for even more. Cat uses its amazing swimming abilities and agility to go through obstacle courses to uncover these lost sea kingdoms.

One day sea animals took over the world after an asteroid mutated all the oceans in the world. Small sea creature civilizations were built around kingdoms and each kingdom housed a king (boss.) Cat once stumbled upon a tasty fish after defeating the king sea slug and ate its treasure treat. The cat wants even more exotic fishes so they go on to defeat more kingdoms.

**Protagonist:** Cat always has a wide cheeky smile across its face. Cat is an orange tabby cat that always wears a submarine helmet. They’re motivated by their appetite to keep eating more tasty kingdom-treats.

**Antagonists:** The environment of the kingdom is manipulated to keep foreigners from the civilizations. The kings of each lair will try to stop Cat from invading.

**Side characters:** King’s henchmens.

**Audience:** Teens and adolescents who like

**Player Motivations:** Exploring new levels, defeating bosses, progressing through story, collecting rewards

**USP:**  
Art style, mythology, progression system

This game is like Overcooked and Mario because the artstyle will resemble those games and also because the colors should be bright and vibrant opposite of gloomy. The storyline progression will also be linear like those games.

**Competing games:** Overcooked. My game is unique because there’s more obstacle courses to get to the levels.

**Induced feelings:** Fun, excitement  
The dialogue of Cat earning a fish, achievement from completing a obstacle level and defeating boss
